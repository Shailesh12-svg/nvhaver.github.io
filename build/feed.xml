So my goal will be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)&lt;/a&gt; cerificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-oscp&quot;&gt;Why OSCP?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other certificates which I could persue, but the OSCP certificate to me feels like the real deal. The exam consists of an 24 hour penetration test which puts your skills to the test. The test simulates a real pentest by providing a network with targets of varying configurations and operating systems on it. The ones in scope need to be enumerated and exploited until administrative privileges are obtained. Like during a real pentest, everything needs to be documented. The final penetration test report should include in-depth notes and screenshots detailing the findings. As stated on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/&quot;&gt;OSCP page&lt;/a&gt;: Points are awarded for each compromised host, based on their difficulty and level of access obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have earned the OSCP certificate, you are able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use multiple information gathering techniques to identify and enumerate targets running various operating systems and services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write basic scripts and tools to aid in the penetration testing process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analyze, correct, modify, cross-compile, and port public exploit code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Successfully conduct both remote and client side attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify and exploit XSS, SQL injection, and file inclusion vulnerabilities in web applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deploy tunneling techniques to bypass firewalls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demonstrate creative problem solving and lateral thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that you can onlt take the exam after completing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security’s Penetration Testing with Kali Linux training course (PWK)&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, this is an online training which you can enroll in for $800. It provides you with a 30-day access to a lab environment over VPN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-certificates&quot;&gt;Other certificates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I will have obtained the OSCP certificate, I will start looking for a new challenge. The other certificates offered by Offensive Security also seem very interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osee-offensive-security-exploitation-expert/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security Exploitation Expert (OSEE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oswe-offensive-security-web-expert/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oswp-offensive-security-wireless-professional/&quot;&gt;Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment however, I think I will have my hands full with the OSCP challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a clear goal set out, it is time to start working on our knowledge and skills in the field of penetration testing, but where do we start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the contents of the PWK course. An outline can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/penetration-testing-with-kali.pdf&quot;&gt;on the Offensive Security website&lt;/a&gt;. Here we can see several big topic to cover such as Kali Linux, programming, scripting, exploits and pentesting as a whole. However, it’s not practical to start taking on these topics at random, we need a more structured approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cybrary.it&quot;&gt;Cybrary&lt;/a&gt; provides us a bit more structure by giving us a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/prep-guide-offsecs-pwkoscp/&quot;&gt;short “must read” list&lt;/a&gt;. They also provide a curriculum to follow which includes their video tutorials, but I prefer to read the original source books instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking around on the web, I identified the following books as the most comprehensive sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nostarch.com/pentesting&quot;&gt;Georgia Weidman’s book “Penetration Testing - A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking” from No Starch Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nostarch.com/metasploit&quot;&gt;David Kennedy, Jim O’Gorman, Devon Kearns, and Mati Aharoni’s “Metasploit - The Penetration Tester’s Guide” from No Starch Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://repo.zenk-security.com/Programmation/Violent%20Python%20a%20Cookbook%20for%20Hackers-Forensic%20Analysts-Penetration%20testers%20and%20Security%20Engineers.pdf&quot;&gt;TJ. O’Connor’s book “Violent Python - A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers” from Syngress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/advanced-penetration-testing-highly-secured-environments-ultimate-security-gu&quot;&gt;Lee Allen’s “Advanced Penetration Testing for Highly-Secured Environments: The Ultimate Security Guide” from Packt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other books on the topics contained in the OSCP certification, but for now I will limit myself to the four above. There are also many other sources from people who attempted the OSCP challenge around the Web, which I list here as honourable mentions. I might dig deeper into these when I need some more details or would like to know about the experience of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-try-harder&quot;&gt;Let’s try harder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that we have everything ready to get started, I will start by reading the book by Georgia Weidman. In the next posts of this series I will highlight my findings on additional sources and provide a small summary of the things I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get busy!&lt;/p&gt;

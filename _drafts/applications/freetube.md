# Freetube

## Introduction

Freetube is an open source HTML5 based desktop application which allows the user to browse watch and download Youtube content without any tracking by Google.
It also supports subscribing to channels without the use of an account. There are no ads.
Only your IP address is sent, but this can also be avoided by using a VPN. Everything else is kept locally.

To play video, it uses the YouTube API directly and for the downloads it relies on the YouTube-dl HTTP API.

# Signal Messaging Application

## What is Signal?

Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging client which focusses on privacy and security.

## But I already have other messaging clients, why Signal?

The most important benefit of using Signal is the underlying business model. Other messaging clients tend to employ business models which are not in the best interest of their users. Often the client is offered for free but either forces advertisements onto its users or abuses their personal data for finanicial gains.  

This is not the case with Signal. The company behind Signal is completely kept afloat on donations.

## There must be a catch, right?

Well, as we all know, security always results in degraded usability. Security can be cumbersome. In the case of Signal this means that some flashy features will not be present, such as support for animated gifs from giphy.

# Footprinting/Reconnaissance

Footprinting can be done in many different ways. For instances, looking up information on people through social media or job sites may expose quite some information. Companies often also expose information through job offers. These include the technologies used in the company. Another source of information is the Wayback timemachine. This site keeps snapshots of all websites that ever existed on the internet, including every change that was made on the site, ordered by timestamp.

This site is a place for me, Nick Van Haver, to collect my thoughts and experiments. 

The inspiration for this site from a technical viewpoint was sparked by Pieter Van Goethem and [Xavier Geerinck's site](http://xaviergeerinck.com). These gentlemen gave me pointers to Github pages and the Jekyll system, so a big shout-out to them.
